## Hello 👋 I'm Milagros


:mortar_board: I recently graduated from Le Wagon school.

🌱 There I learned to code with Ruby on Rails, Ruby, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I keep on developing these skills every day.

:space_invader: I’m looking to join a new team as a junior full-stack web developer and work on new projects.

In my repositories, you will find my work completed during the 9 weeks at Le Wagon, which includes:

🗓 The daily exercises to learn how to code
👯 Two repositories for group projects: - 👩🏻‍🍳 One was an airbnb-like platform to order homemade meals.  - 🏃🏻‍♀️ And the other was a mobile app to connect with fellow runners and join them on a run.

## Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Milagros


:mortar_board: I'm a Frontend Developer.

ðŸŒ± I used to work in publishing but eventually switched gears and after studying at Le Wagon school, I joined Crealo's team: a platform that helps publishers handle their royalties payments more efficiently.

:space_invader: Iâ€™m always looking to improve my skills and dive deeper into the world of coding and design.
